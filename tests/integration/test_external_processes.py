"""
Integration tests for external process management.

These tests verify that the app properly:
- Integrates with MPV for audio playback
- Handles yt-dlp for stream extraction
- Manages process lifecycle and cleanup
- Handles external tool failures gracefully

Note: Some tests require external dependencies (mpv, yt-dlp, psutil).
